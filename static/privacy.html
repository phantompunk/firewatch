            <h2>Photo & Video Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Modern cameras and phones embed hidden data in photos called EXIF metadata.
                This can include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>GPS coordinates where the photo was taken</li>
                <li>Date and time</li>
                <li>Device model and serial number</li>
                <li>Camera settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Our system automatically removes all this metadata</strong> from any
                photos or videos you upload, both in your browser before upload and on
                our server as a backup measure.

            <h2>For Maximum Privacy</h2>
            <p>While our system protects your anonymity, you can take additional steps:</p>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Tor Browser</strong>
                    <p>Tor routes your connection through multiple servers, hiding your location from everyone including us.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use Private/Incognito Mode</strong>
                    <p>This prevents your browser from saving history of your visit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use a Public Computer</strong>
                    <p>A library or internet cafe computer isn't linked to your identity.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid Personal Details in Reports</strong>
                    <p>Don't mention your name, address, or other identifying information in your report text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clear History After Submitting</strong>
                    <p>Clear your browser history and close all tabs after submitting a report.</p>
